Windows 11 comes with [Segoe UI Emoji](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/segoe-ui-emoji) font.
It features flat colored emojis, thick black outlines and geometric shapes.

Microsoft does not place any restrictions on what you do with print output that uses these fonts. THey view creating graphic files as being essentially the same as printing from an output device.
